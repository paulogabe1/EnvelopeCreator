# EnvelopeCreator
Envelope Creator Expansion for Toon Boom Harmony 24
I don't know if this will work fine on previous versions of harmony

- Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Toon Boom Animation\Toon Boom Harmony 24 Premium\Plugins\EnvelopeCreator\resources
- If you're on a mac, you can go to the program's folder and search for the keyword "envelope"
- Backup the files "EnvelopeCreator.js" and "EnvelopeCreator.ui". You can simply put them in a new folder in the same directory
- Put the new files from this repository in the "resources" folder
- If you prefer to copy the code from this repository and update the files, you are probably going to have trouble with permissions trying to save in the "resources" folder. Copy the code into files in another folder first and them copy/move them into the "resources" folder
